# BEGINNER LEVEL
# 1. Print each number from 1 to 20 using a for loop.
# Write your code below:
for i in (1,21):
  print(i)


# INTERMEDIATE LEVEL
# 2. Given a list of fruits, use a for loop to print only the fruits that have more than 5 letters.
for i in fruits:
  if len(i) >4:
  print(i)
fruits  = ["apple","kiwi","banana", "pear", "pineapple","plum"]

fruits = ["apple", "kiwi", "banana", "pear", "pineapple", "plum"k\\
# Write your code below:


# ADVANCED LEVEL
# 3. Using a for loop, count how many even and odd numbers exist in the list below.
numbers = [12, 5, 8, 19, 44, 2, 7, 18, 33, 50]
# Your code should print:
# "Even: X"
# "Odd: Y"
# Write your code below:

for i in numbers:
    for i % 2 == 0:
    even += 1
eles
    odd += 1


# EXPERT LEVEL
# 4. Nested for-loop challenge:
# Write a program that prints a multiplication table (1 through 10) in a grid format.
# Example (first 3 rows shown):
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
